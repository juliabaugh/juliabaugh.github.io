						<br>
						The Chesapeake Bay Foundation's Brock Environmental Center is a model of sustainability.  The Center feeds solar and wind powered energy back to the grid after harvesting what's needed, collects rainfall that provides 100% of all water used, including the high standard of drinking water, exemplifies zero waste and emissions, and models how building materials can be so natural and non-toxic, you could almost put it in a blender and drink it.  The Center is a net positive, making a significant contribution through restoring habitat, educating youth, and being a regional hub of outreach and advocacy.  The Center went beyond LEED Platinum to fully meet the high bar of the Living  Building Challenge. Janet was the green consultant that took the lofty goals, and through careful and determined scrutiny of all aspects of site development and building, created a building that lives and breathes nature.

						accomplish the non-profits goal of connecting people with parks and nature. It
						includes a park restoration, historic rehabilitation and new construction, with an
						ecology center designed to accommodate both adults and schoolchildren. It
						offers flexible laboratory space for research, environmental education, job
						training and career development.

						This state of the art sustainable building was built not just as an office, but as a teaching tool, to demonstrate that sustainable design principles could be used in mainstream buildings. The project is oriented to maximize passive solarprinciples and makes use of daylighting, shading, and natural ventilation strategies. More than half of the materials used in the building come from within a radius of 300 miles, most other materials are salvaged, renewable, or recycled. The building uses renewable energy sources such as hot water solar, photovoltaic, and ground source heat pumps. Rainwater is collected from the roof, but all toilets are composting and no water is used for toilets or irrigation, so the building uses only 10% of the potable water used by a typical office building. In addition to the LEED Platinum Award, this project won the NOVA Award for Construction Innovation in 2003, the Business Week/Architectural Record Award in 2001, and was one of the AIA/COTE Top Ten Green Projects in 2001.

						This new 24000 square foot project was designed not only as a shelter but as a homeless prevention support center. Energy use is reduced by over 40% with strategies such as a well-insulated envelope, light colored roofing, energy efficient lighting, demand control ventilation, a ground source heat pump, and energy efficient equipment. Other sustainable strategies include low VOC finishes, recycled materials, and local materials. The Light House has a robust alternative transportation program including free bus passes and bicycles for the guests to use.

						The Nanticoke Residence was designed for serious environmentalists who practice what they preach. They went above and beyond with a composting toilet, a nitrogen reducing septic tank, and water saving fixtures. Wood was either FSC certified, salvaged from old timber docks, or harvested by horses to minimize forest disturbance. Energy use is reduced by generous insulation, a ground source heat pump, tankless water heaters, and photovoltaic panels. The home has now become a field station for Salisbury University and is a great teaching tool for their environmental program.

						On Fox Island, students experience a way of life completely off the grid. Photovoltaic panels provide electricity for lights and a refrigerator. Students pedal a bicycle to pump water from a well. Composting toilets use no water. All food waste is composted. All trash is sorted into recycling containers. Cooling is provided by natural ventilation – cross breezes through operable windows. It is an unrivaled platform for students to understand the concept of a small planet. At the same time they are immersed in the earth at its purest, exploring the marshes, experiencing first hand the birds, fish, wildlife, weather, stars, tides, and natural cycles.
						<br><br>
						Originally built in 1929, this old hunting lodge was renovated in 1978 to start the environmental center, and renovated again in 2004 after Hurricane Isobel.
